      <br /></p>    <h2>Using Cricket FFT<br />    </h2>    <p>What follows is a very brief introduction to using Cricket FFT.  For more      detailed API documentation, have a look at the header file (<tt>inc/ckfft/ckfft.h</tt>). 
      There is also a simple working example program in <tt>src/example</tt>.       <br />    </p>    <p>First, create a <tt>CkFftContext</tt> object with a call to <tt>CkFftInit()</tt>. 
      For example:<br />    </p>    <p><code>#include "ckfft/ckfft.h"<br />        <br />        // Create a context for forward or inverse FFTs with n=2048 or less<br />        CkFftContext* context = CkFftInit(2048, CkFftDirection_Both, NULL, NULL)</code><br />      Typically you will create one context when your program starts up that      will be used for all FFTs.  If you pass in NULL for the last two      arguments, <tt>CkFftInit()</tt> will allocate its own memory for the      context.<br />    </p>    <p>Most likely, you will want to do a forward FFT on real input data; for      example:<br />    </p>    <p><code>// input is an array of 2048 floats; <br />        // output is an array of 1025 CkFftComplex structs.<br />        CkFftRealForward(context, 2048, input, output);</code><br />      Note that for an FFT on N real values, only N/2+1 complex values are      calculated, rather than N; the remaining values are simply complex      conjugates of the first values.</p>    <p>You can also perform the inverse transform:</p>    <p><code>// output is the array of 1025 CkFftComplex structs from the        previous example;<br />        // output2 is an array of 2048 floats;<br />        // tmpBuf is an array of 1025 CkFftComplex structs.<br />        CkFftRealInverse(context, 2048, output, output2, tmpBuf);</code><br />      Finally, destroy your context when you no longer need it (when your      program exits, for example):</p>    <p><code>CkFftShutdown(context);</code><br />    </p>    <h2>Building with Cricket FFT</h2>    <p>Take a look at the project in <tt>src/example</tt> for an example of how      to build Cricket FFT and link to it on the various platforms.<br />    </p>    <p>For iOS or OS X, add the Xcode project in <tt>src/ckfft/ios</tt> or <tt>src/ckfft/macos</tt>      to your workspace.  In the build settings for your executable project, add      the inc directory to your header search path; in the build phases for your      executable project, add libckfft_ios.a or libckfft_macos.a to the "Link      Binary With Libraries" phase.</p>    <p>For Windows, there are project files for both Visual Studio 2010 and      Visual Studio 2012 in <tt>src/ckfft/win</tt>.  Add the appropriate      project to your solution, add the inc directory to your header search      path, add the appropriate library directory to your library search path,      and add ckfft.lib to your link line.</p>    <p>For the Android NDK, an Android.mk file is included in <tt>src/ckfft/android</tt>      which defines it as a "prebuilt" library.  Use <tt>$(call        import-module,ckfft)</tt> in your shared library's Android.mk to import      it.<br />    </p>    <br />  </body></html>
